          <span>Chicken</span>
          <p>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. If your chicken has been refrigerated, let it come up to room temperature.

      Cut the unpeeled potatoes into 2cm-thick chips, then parboil in a pan of salted water with one of the whole lemons for 4 to 6 minutes.

      Drain in a colander (remove the lemon and set aside for the dressing), leave to steam dry for a couple of minutes, then shake them around a little to create rough edges – this will help to make them nice and crispy.

      Massage a little olive oil, sea salt and black pepper into the chicken. Halve the remaining lemon, then rub one half over the bird, before popping both halves into the cavity. 

      Place the chicken, breast-side-down, directly on the grills in the middle of the oven – most of the fat is in the back of the bird, so this will allow the juices to run into the breast and keep all of the meat moist. 

      Position a tray on the shelf below to catch the juices (you’ll need these for the chips), and roast the chicken for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until cooked through, turning the chicken over after 45 minutes to crisp up the rest of the skin.

        	<span>Beef</span>
        	<p>Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then finely grate the lemon zest. Clean and tear the mushrooms. Pick and finely chop the parsley.

			Place the beef between 2 sheets of clingfilm. Bash with a rolling pin until ½ cm thick, then cut into finger-width slices. 

			Mix the paprika, lemon zest, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper together, and use to dust the beef. 

			In a large frying pan over a medium-low heat, fry the onion and garlic in a little oil until softened. Turn up the heat and add the mushrooms and butter, sautéing until the mushrooms are golden brown, then tip onto a plate

			Add a little oil to the pan and fry the beef for 2 minutes, turning, until browned but still pink inside. Stir in the mushroom-onion mixture, add the brandy and reduce for 1 minute or until almost disappeared.

			Remove from the heat and stir in the cream and parsley. Delicious serve with bread and gherkins.

        	<span>Sushi</span>
        	<p>Put the rice in a small saucepan with 375ml water, leave to soak for 30 minutes, then bring to the boil. 

			Put the lid on and simmer gently for 10 minutes, until the water has been absorbed by the rice. 

			In a bowl, dissolve the sugar in the vinegar, then sprinkle over the rice mix, combining with a rubber spatula so as not to break up the rice. 

			Allow to cool for 20 minutes before using.

			Deseed or peel the vegetables, then cut into fine strips or batons.

			Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat, then spread half the rice over the sheet except for 1cm clear at the top. 

			Add some vegetables in a horizontal line across the rice. 

			Begin rolling the mat from the near edge, keeping the filling in place with your fingers. Roll firmly but not too hard. 

			Remove the roll from the mat and cut into 6 or 8 pieces. Repeat with second piece of nori.
			Tips

			To make a California roll, cover a sheet of nori with the sushi rice, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds, then carefully turn the sheet of nori 
			and rice over onto the sushi mat so the rice is on the bottom and nori on top. Add any combination of fillings, roll and chop as before.
